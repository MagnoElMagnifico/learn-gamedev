# learn-gamedev

Learning GameDev from scratch through several dummy projects. Each one is in its
own directory, sorted by creation date.

# Running

For now, each project has its own individual Makefile. You may need a C++
compiler and install some dependencies (`libsfml-dev`, [SFML]).

Note that the executable files produced will be stored in the `bin` folder.
